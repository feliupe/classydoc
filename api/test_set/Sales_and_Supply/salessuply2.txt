B. Buyer is engaged in the business of producing, distributing and selling lean beef, pork and other meat products and currently has production facilities in Amarillo, Texas; Finney County, Kansas; Waterloo, Iowa; and South Sioux City, Nebraska. The majority of shareholders of Buyer, Eldon and Regina Roth, are also the owners of NBPCO Holdings, LLC. NBPCO Holdings, LLC is a member of National Beef Packing Company, LLC.
C. By virtue of the National Beef Packing Company, LLC operating agreement, Buyer purchases all of the beef trimmings containing less than 50% lean content produced at National Beef Packing Company, LLC�s facilities. Seller�s facilities also produce beef trimmings containing less than 50% lean content that comply with the specifications described in Exhibit B (�Raw Materials� or �XP Trim�) attached to this agreement and incorporated by this reference.
D. Similarly, Buyer has certain Exclusive Supply Agreements in place for the Raw Materials produced at Seller�s facilities in Grand Island, NE and Dumas, TX and from time to time purchases additional Raw Materials from Seller�s facilities in Greeley, CO and Hyrum, UT.
E. Contemporaneously with this Agreement Seller, will enter into a certain agreement to purchase National Beef (the �Transaction�); however, NBPCO Holdings, LLC must consent to that transaction. NBPCO Holdings, LLC is willing to consent to such transaction contingent upon the execution of this Agreement with Buyer. Seller desires to sell, and Buyer desires to purchase, all of Seller�s Raw Materials, under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals (which are specifically incorporated herein by this reference) and the mutual covenants described below, the parties agree as follows:
1. Sale and Purchase of Raw Materials. Subject to the limitations below, Seller shall sell, and Buyer shall purchase, all of the Raw Materials that Seller can produce at the Locations. With the exception of the current supply agreements with Ed Minlat, Inc. and Jack-in-the-Box
(which shall not be renewed or the term otherwise extended beyond their respective current terms), Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, agents, other related entities, or other entities or persons under Seller�s actual or apparent control, shall directly or indirectly, produce for, supply to, or sell to anyone other than Buyer, any Raw Materials or otherwise use any Raw Materials for purposes competitive with Buyer�s production of BPI� Boneless Lean Beef Trimmings. The parties acknowledge that Buyer may purchase Raw Materials from other suppliers provided that Buyer has purchased, or still purchases all of Seller�s available Raw Materials under the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller shall be permitted to sell on a spot market basis, any Raw Materials that do not meet the Raw Material Specifications defined in Exhibit B and are rejected or refused by the Buyer to a third party.
2. Quantity. As of the Effective Date, it is estimated that Seller will be able to produce the Raw Materials in the amounts indicated on Exhibit C for each facility. This production rate is only an estimate and Buyer shall accept any reasonable amount of Raw Materials. While Seller is under no obligation to produce any minimum quantity of the Raw Materials, certain terms and conditions relating to the Purchase Price (defined below) may vary based upon pound per head achieved or other volume and quality measurements for the Raw Materials.
3. Purchase Price. The �Purchase Price� for the Raw Materials shall be calculated in accordance with the attached Exhibit A. Seller shall invoice Buyer each week for the Raw Materials delivered to and accepted by Buyer during the immediate preceding week. Buyer shall pay each invoice within 7 days after receipt of the applicable invoice.
(a) If at any time during the terms of this Agreement, Buyer offers to purchase from a third party a product substantially similar to the Raw Materials provided under this Agreement at a price and on terms that are more favorable than the price and terms of this Agreement, then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing and Seller shall have the option to adjust the Purchase Price and the associated terms of this Agreement to be as favorable as what is offered to the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligations under this section unless such third party purchases the products on a contract basis in quantities greater than 40 loads per week.
4. Shipments. Seller shall ship all the Raw Materials as soon as practicable following production of the Raw Materials in accordance with the customary past practice of the Parties. Shipments will be FOB the applicable Location with title passing upon Buyer�s acceptance (provided such acceptance is accomplished promptly after delivery) of the applicable Raw Materials at Buyer�s facility. Seller shall ensure that all of the Raw Materials are suitably packed and marked in accordance with the requirements of common carriers and the Raw Materials Specifications (defined below). All shipments are to be inspected by Seller prior to shipment to Buyer to provide reasonable assurances that such Raw Materials comply with the Raw Material Specifications. Buyer shall notify Seller if Buyer does not accept the Raw Materials and shall consult with Seller regarding the disposition of such Raw Materials. Such inspection by Buyer shall not waive Buyer�s right to later reject such Raw Materials or pursue damages against Seller for Raw Materials that do not comply with Seller�s warranties in Section 11.

Contracts drafted by the legal experts of Global Negotiator cover all relevant aspects that are
negotiated and agreed in the different types of business between companies. However, when
these contracts are used you should take into
account some recommendations common to all
of them that are described in this User Guide.
DATE
The  date  when  the  contract  comes  into  force  is  the  one  that  appears  in  its  header,  as
mentioned in the final paragraphs of the contract, before signatures (Th
is Contract comes into
force on the date written above).
In  some  contracts
-
for
example  in  the  Supply  Contract
-
the  date  of  coming  into  force  is  also
mentioned in one of the clauses. In these cases you have to verify that the two dates inserted
in the con

discrepancies.

Otherwise, make a list, including value, of each asset which will be sold to the Buyer from the Seller. If necessary, reference "schedules," or attachments, and include them with this document, with the understanding that both parties are signing off on the schedules as well as the provisions listed here.
