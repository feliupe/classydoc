at closing, the Property in its damaged state will be accepted and all insurance proceeds will be assigned from the Seller to the Buyer and the Buyer will receive an amount equal to the deductible under the Seller's insurance policy.

seek specific performance;
seek other relief as may be provided by law; or
seek a combination of any or all of the above remedies; or

Escrow
The Seller and the Buyer agree that the escrow agent is not:

The notice of the escrow agent to either Party will be deemed effective upon its deposit to any US Postal Service offices or mailboxes with receipt requested, provided that the notice contains adequate postage and the correct mailing address of the Party contained in this Agreement is inscribed on the notice. The notice of objection to the demand of earnest money will be deemed effective upon receipt by the escrow agent.
Seller Representations
The Seller represents and warrants that there will be no liens, assessments, or security interests from third parties against the Property which will not be satisfied out of the sales proceeds.
