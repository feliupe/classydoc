Article XIII –  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND NON-COMPETITION
XIII.1 When and if required, OWNER will furnish DISTRIBUTOR the necessary information so that DISTRIBUTOR can fulfill its obligations hereunder regarding the registration of the Product to be distributed in the Territory.  This information shall constitute part of the Confidential Information defined in Section 1.1(d).
XIII.2 From time to time, OWNER may periodically provide DISTRIBUTOR with new or up-graded data that has become available, documentation, tests, reports or other pertinent information relating to the Product or otherwise, which information will also form part of the Confidential Information and which will assist in keeping DISTRIBUTOR knowledgeable in regard to the Product and maintaining a competitive edge in the marketing and sales of the Product.
XIII.3 DISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that in its relationship with OWNER and/or by virtue of the performance of this Agreement, it and/or its employees, shareholders, officers, directors, principals, agents and contractors (collectively, “Representatives”) will be and shall hereafter continue to be entrusted with Confidential Information, the disclosure of any of which to competitors of OWNER or to the general public would be highly detrimental to the best interests of OWNER.  DISTRIBUTOR further acknowledges that the right to maintain confidential such Confidential Information constitutes a proprietary right of OWNER, which OWNER is entitled to protect.  Accordingly, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein expressed, DISTRIBUTOR covenants and agrees with OWNER:
(a) that it shall not use or copy, or permit the use or copy of any of the Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than the discharge of its duties and obligations arising from its appointment as a DISTRIBUTOR hereunder and only in the best interests of OWNER;
(b) that it will maintain the absolute confidentiality of the Confidential Information and that it will not (without the prior written consent of OWNER) either individually, or in partnership or jointly, or in conjunction with any other Person, as principal, agent, shareholder, or in any manner whatsoever, disclose, reveal, release, utilize, sell, assign, supply, or transfer to any person at any time, any of the Confidential Information, except to the extent necessary to discharge its duties and obligations relating to its appointment hereunder and only in the best interests of OWNER;
(c) that it will take all necessary action and will do all that is reasonably within its power to prevent the disclosure, release or supply of any of the Confidential Information to any Person, including by any of its Representatives, except to the extent necessary to discharge its duties and obligations hereunder and only in the best interests of OWNER;
(d) in furtherance of the above, DISTRIBUTOR will advise its Representatives, and any other Persons who are given access to the Confidential Information, of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the restrictions imposed by this Agreement and, if appropriate, shall require each of them to signify in writing their agreement to abide by the terms of this Agreement and maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding any such agreement, by any of such Representatives, DISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it shall be fully responsible and liable to OWNER for any and all damages and costs (including legal fees) suffered or incurred by it as a consequence of any breach by any of DISTRIBUTOR’s Representatives, and/or any other Persons given access to the Confidential Information, of the restrictive covenants contained herein.
XIII.4 DISTRIBUTOR shall not, directly or indirectly, develop, manufacture or distribute any products similar to or competitive with the Product in the Territory or elsewhere.  DISTRIBUTOR hereby further covenants and agrees that during the Term of this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement DISTRIBUTOR shall not, for whatever reason, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person as principal, agent, employee, shareholder, owner, investor, partner or in any other manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, carry on or be engaged in or be concerned with or interested in, or advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name or any part thereof to be used or employed by any Person engaged in or concerned with or interested in, the business of manufacturing, developing, producing, marketing, distributing, supplying or selling, for wholesale or retail, nor shall it hold in stock or solicit or be directly engaged or interested in soliciting orders for, any products similar to or competitive with the Product within the Territory.
XIII.5 DISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 13.3 and 13.4 are reasonable and valid and necessary for the protection of the business and operations of OWNER and that any breach of the provisions will cause OWNER substantial and irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by monetary award of damages to OWNER.  Accordingly, it is expressly agreed by DISTRIBUTOR that in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to it, OWNER shall be entitled to and may seek an order for specific performance and other injunctive and equitable relief as may be considered necessary or appropriate to restrain or enjoin DISTRIBUTOR from any further breach of the terms hereof and DISTRIBUTOR hereby waives all defences to the strict enforcement by OWNER of the restrictions herein.
XIII.6 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, DISTRIBUTOR shall immediately return to OWNER any Confidential Information and shall thereafter refrain from using or disclosing any such Confidential Information to any Person for any purpose whatsoever.

Article XIX –  GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION
XIX.1 The parties agree that the validity, operation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein (notwithstanding conflict of law rules), and the parties do expressly and irrevocably attorn to the jurisdiction of courts of Ontario with respect to any matter or claim, suit, action or proceeding arising under or related to this Agreement.  To the fullest extend permitted by applicable law, DISTRIBUTOR waives and agrees not to assert, as a defense or otherwise, (i) any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction (in personam or otherwise) of any such court, (ii) any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such court, or (iii) any claim that any action, suit or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
XIX.2 Any dispute concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof (a “Dispute”) will be settled exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.  The party seeking resolution of a Dispute will first give notice in writing of the Dispute to the other party, setting forth the nature of the Dispute and a concise statement of the issues to be resolved.  If the Dispute has not been resolved through good faith efforts and negotiations of senior officers or representatives of the parties within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the relevant party of the notice of Dispute, such notice will be deemed to be a notice of arbitration and the parties agree to submit the Dispute to a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to both parties.  In the event that the parties cannot agree on a sole arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed by a judge of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on application by either party to the Dispute.  All arbitration, proceedings and hearings will be conducted in the English language in accordance with the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as set out in the Schedule to the International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O., 1990, Chap. 19 and the UNCITRAL arbitration rules then in force.  All decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties for all questions submitted to such arbitrator and the costs associated with such submission shall be shared equally by the parties involved in the Dispute unless the arbitrator decides otherwise.  The parties waive all rights of appeal therefore to any court or tribunal, and agree that the only recourse by any party to any court will be for the purpose of enforcing an arbitration award.
Article XX –  guarantee
XX.1 [The Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to OWNER the punctual and complete fulfillment, payment and performance when due of all obligations, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all present and future debts, liabilities and obligations, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent of DISTRIBUTOR to OWNER under the terms of this Agreement and any schedules hereto or ancillary agreements entered into pursuant hereto.  The Guarantor further covenants and agrees that OWNER may, without the Guarantor’s consent and without notice to it, and without affecting the Guarantor’s liability, extend the time for payment or release or deal with or take away proceedings or sue or bring any action or enter any judgment against DISTRIBUTOR as in its absolute discretion OWNER may see fit, and that no such act or failure to act by OWNER shall in any way release the Guarantor from the performance of any obligations or payment of any amounts due by DISTRIBUTOR hereunder, and that this covenant shall remain in full force and effect until all obligations and/or amounts payable to OWNER under this Agreement, any schedule hereto and any ancillary agreements entered into pursuant hereto are fully discharged, paid and satisfied.

XX.2 The liability of the Guarantor under the guarantee (the “Guarantee”) contemplated by this Article XIX is absolute and unconditional and the Guarantee shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense based upon any claim the Guarantor may have against OWNER, hereunder or otherwise, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not the Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor, including insolvency or bankruptcy; provided that any claim hereunder against the Guarantor shall be subject to, and the Guarantor shall have available to it in defense of any such claim, any and all of DISTRIBUTOR’s rights and defenses in respect of any such claim other than any defense based on the insolvency or bankruptcy of DISTRIBUTOR.

XX.3 The Guarantor shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) reasonably incurred by or on behalf of OWNER in enforcing the obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

XX.4 To the extent of any payment by the Guarantor to OWNER hereunder, the Guarantor shall succeed to all corresponding claims that OWNER may have and otherwise shall be subrogated to the rights of OWNER against DISTRIBUTOR in respect thereof.

XX.5 Any failure on the part of OWNER to perfect, maintain or enforce any rights against DISTRIBUTOR shall not prejudice OWNER with respect to its rights pursuant to this Guarantee, and shall not discharge or limit or lessen the liability of the Guarantor pursuant to the terms hereof.  OWNER shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse against DISTRIBUTOR or any other Person before being entitled to payment or performance under this Guarantee and the Guarantor waives any rights to require OWNER to first proceed against DISTRIBUTOR and renounces all benefits of discussion and division and expressly agrees that as between the Guarantor and OWNER, the Guarantor shall be considered as primarily liable for any such payment or performance.

XX.6 The Guarantor further waive any defence arising by reason of any disability or other defence of DISTRIBUTOR, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of DISTRIBUTOR, and further the Guarantor waive any right of set-off, counter-claim, subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution (contractual, statutory or otherwise), arising from the existence or performance of this Guarantee and the Guarantor waives any right to enforce any remedy which OWNER now has or may hereafter have against DISTRIBUTOR, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by OWNER.  The Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of non-performance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonour, and notices of acceptance of this Guarantee and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.

XX.7 The obligation of the Guarantor under this Article XIX is a continuing guarantee and the obligations of the Guarantor under Article XIX are continuing obligations.  Article XIX extends to all present and future guaranteed obligations of the Guarantor, applies to and secures the ultimate balance of the guaranteed obligations due or remaining due to OWNER and is binding as a continuing obligation of the Guarantor until  OWNER releases the Guarantor.  This Guarantee will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the guaranteed obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by OWNER upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

XX.8 Any obligations of DISTRIBUTOR to the Guarantor, now or hereafter existing, including but not limited to any obligations to the Guarantor as subrogee of DISTRIBUTOR or resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guarantee are hereby assigned to OWNER and postponed and subordinated to the indebtedness.  Any such obligations of DISTRIBUTOR to the Guarantor received by the Guarantor shall be received in trust for OWNER and the proceeds thereof shall forthwith be paid over to OWNER on account of the indebtedness of DISTRIBUTOR to OWNER, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the provisions of this Guarantee.  This assignment and postponement is independent of and severable from this Guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect whether or not the Guarantor is liable for any amount under this Guarantee.

XX.9 The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any account settled or stated by or between OWNER and DISTRIBUTOR, or, if any such account has not been so settled or stated immediately before demand for payment under this Guarantee, any account stated by OWNER, shall be accepted by the Guarantor as prima facie evidence of the amount which at the date of the account so settled or stated is due by DISTRIBUTOR to OWNER or remains unpaid by DISTRIBUTOR to OWNER.

XX.10 If any provision of this Guarantee is determined in any proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or to be wholly or partly unenforceable, that provision shall for the purposes of such proceeding, be severed from this Guarantee at OWNER's option and shall be treated as not forming a part hereof and all the remaining provisions of this Guarantee shall remain in full force and be unaffected thereby.

XX.11 This Guarantee shall not be subject to or affected by any promise or condition affecting or limiting the liability of the Guarantor except as expressly set forth herein and no statement, representation, agreement or promise on the part of OWNER or any officer, employee or agent thereof, unless contained herein, forms any part of this contract or has induced the making thereof or shall be deemed in any way to affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder.]
